# Blog Card

In conjunction with Flask this is my attempt at one of the frontend mentor challenges. I'm very new to web development and am not yet familiar with best practices, or how to make a completely responsive website to changing browsers sizes. This is the thing I struggled with here. The project looks identical to the challenge requirement picture (desktop and mobile) but messing around with the size causes problems to arise.
